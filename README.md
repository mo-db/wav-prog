# wav-prog

## description
The project is about generating and manipulating audio in form of C code. Because audio api's are 
really complicated to start with I will not look into realtime audio and application audio in/output.
I will instead only write and read wav files. 

## what I need
- file to organize references and informations -> refs_inf.md
- wav file player
